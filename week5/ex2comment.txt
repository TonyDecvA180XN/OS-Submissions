The execution ex2 starts with 'ex2launcher.sh'

Without using a mutex we have a race condition. This is output file
with numbers before:

0
1
1
2
2
3
3
4
4
5
5
6
6
7
7
8
8
9
9
10

We have almost all numbers doubled because the following line of code
happen ~simultaniously:

// Critical region
NUMBER=$(tail -n 1 < numbers.txt)
expr $NUMBER + 1 >> numbers.txt

That means the file is read twice and number is appended twice.

After we implement a mutex the result is fixed:

0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

The critical section of each scrypt is entered only if it is free.
Hence, none increment operation is doubled.
