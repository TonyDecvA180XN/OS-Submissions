Three strategies of dealing
with deadlocks:
• recovery
• prevention
• avoidance

Recovery
    Can be used in system with cheap rollback operation. Also, when the process can be killed without consequences (like in video games)

Prevention
    Since there we need to eliminate one of the conditions, that is likely to be circular wait.
    For that we have simple strategies, for example assigning resources and processes with a numerical number. 
    A process can request the resources only by increasing numbering.

    Also, we can eliminate hold and wait, but it lead us to data starvation.

    One of simplest methods.


Avoidance
    The hardest one.

    Can be used only when system has access to all resources and available commands, as well as process requests.

    However, it can block processes for too long.
    Thus, should be used only in systems with high performance, the highest security and responsibility, but with assumption of delays.
