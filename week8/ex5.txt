What is the difference between a physical and a virtual address?

Physical address is an index of a cell in memory stick (or unit).
If say "read cell 0xffffffff" that means access this specific cell directly.

Virtual address is imaginary address which is later translated to a physical memory address.
Each process thinks that it owns the whole memory and treat it like physical.
But when it tries to access it memory unit offsets it to the corresponding memory block (aka page).
Hence OS can have multiple processes running at a time using the same memory and treating it as its own.
All necessary data about which page belongs to each process is stored in the page table.
