First program gives output:
-------------------
Hello
Hello
-------------------
And second one gives the following:
-------------------
Hello


-------------------
We know that when we call printf() all characters it gets are saved
in the buffer. It has a fixed size. And is not going to be flushed until
it is full or we send a "\n" character.

Therefore, we have for the 1st program:
We put "Hello" in the buffer.
The process if forked.
We put "\n" in the buffer of original program.
Original program flushes the buffer and "Hello\n" is printed.
We put "\n" in the buffer of forked program.
Forked program flushes the buffer and "Hello\n" is printed.

And for the 2nd program:
We put "Hello" in the buffer.
We put "\n" in the buffer.
Program flushes the buffer and "Hello\n" is printed.
The process if forked.
We put "\n" in the buffer of original program.
Original program flushes the buffer and "\n" is printed.
We put "\n" in the buffer of forked program.
Forked program flushes the buffer and "\n" is printed.
