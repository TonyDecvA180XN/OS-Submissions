The sample output of ex1.sh script is:
Hello from parent [PID - 3279]
Hello from child [PID - 0]
Hello from parent [PID - 3281]
Hello from child [PID - 0]
Hello from parent [PID - 3283]
Hello from child [PID - 0]
Hello from parent [PID - 3285]
Hello from child [PID - 0]
Hello from parent [PID - 3287]
Hello from child [PID - 0]
Hello from parent [PID - 3289]
Hello from child [PID - 0]
Hello from parent [PID - 3291]
Hello from child [PID - 0]
Hello from parent [PID - 3293]
Hello from child [PID - 0]
Hello from parent [PID - 3295]
Hello from child [PID - 0]
Hello from parent [PID - 3297]
Hello from child [PID - 0]

The output depends on n which has the returning value of fork() function.

"""
It takes no parameters and returns an integer value. Below are different values returned by fork().

Negative Value: creation of a child process was unsuccessful.
Zero: Returned to the newly created child process.
Positive value: Returned to parent or caller. The value contains process ID of newly created child process.
"""

Hence, all child processes have zero n value. 
Parent processes have their unique value which is given when program starts. 
It is determined by OS to distinguish processes and alwasys have different values.
Generally parent is printed first, since its process had to print the text only while its child was busy by new process initiation.
However, it isn't always like that.
